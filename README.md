# face-detect-interface
This is the first of two parts of a loosely coupled application.
It is a face detection application and will consists of;<br>
      <br>a) an interface that the user communicates with 
      <br>b) a machine learning function that interpretes the images sent by the interface.
<br><br>
 
This part is the interface the user communicates with directly. It has a user model that stores user information and authenticates them.
<br>
<br>
The interface will primarily communicate with the machine learning model (the second part) through api calls and will display the results after analysing the image.
The interface is being written in javascript node.js and the other side will be written in python django. <br>The reason for writing the machine learning functions in python is that python has more support and is easier to use for datascience. I have also been using python for data science for a while so that seems to be a better option.
